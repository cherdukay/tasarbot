Install the SDK
Anthropic provides SDKs for Python (3.7+) and TypeScript (4.5+).

Python
TypeScript
In your project directory, create a virtual environment.

Python

python -m venv claude-env
Activate the virtual environment using

On macOS or Linux, source claude-env/bin/activate
On Windows, claude-env\Scripts\activate
Python

pip install anthropic
​
Set your API key
Every API call requires a valid API key. The SDKs are designed to pull the API key from an environmental variable ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. You can also supply the key to the Anthropic client when initializing it.

macOS and Linux
Windows

export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
​
Call the API
Call the API by passing the proper parameters to the /messages/create endpoint.

Note that the code provided by the Workbench sets the API key in the constructor. If you set the API key as an environment variable, you can omit that line as below.

Python
TypeScript
claude_quickstart.py

import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1000,
    temperature=0,
    system="You are a world-class poet. Respond only with short poems.",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Why is the ocean salty?"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
print(message.content)
Run the code using python3 claude_quickstart.py or node claude_quickstart.js.

Response

[TextBlock(text="The ocean's salty brine,\nA tale of time and design.\nRocks and rivers, their minerals shed,\nAccumulating in the ocean's bed.\nEvaporation leaves salt behind,\nIn the vast waters, forever enshrined.", type='text')]
The Workbench and code examples use default model settings for: model (name), temperature, and max tokens to sample.
This quickstart shows how to develop a basic, but functional, Claude-powered application using the Console, Workbench, and API. You can use this same workflow as the foundation for much more powerful use cases.
